            <h3>Academic Background</h3>
            <p>
              I’ve built a strong foundation in full-stack web development through a diverse set of college-level
              courses that emphasized hands-on learning and industry-relevant skills. Starting with core fundamentals in
              programming logic and web systems, I progressed into advanced client-side and backend technologies that
              allowed me to craft dynamic, scalable applications. In courses like CS 2350 and WEB 2700, I explored
              server configuration, RESTful APIs, authentication methods, and database integration—gaining practical
              experience that mirrors real-world development challenges.
            </p>
            <p>
              On the frontend, I developed a deep understanding of responsive design, user experience, and modern
              JavaScript frameworks through classes like CS 3350 and WEB 1430. These courses sharpened my ability to
              build sleek interfaces that are intuitive and accessible. My education also emphasized teamwork, Git
              version control, and agile development workflows, especially during my full-stack project in WEB 2890.
              Altogether, this academic journey reflects my commitment to writing clean, efficient code and delivering
              complete web solutions from concept to deployment.

            <h3>Professional Experience</h3>
            <p>
              My career began in the construction world, where I learned the value of grit, precision, and perseverance
              from the ground up. Starting out in a demanding field taught me how to navigate tough environments,
              communicate clearly, and lead by example. I rose through the ranks—from laborer to operator, and now
              foreman—not just by mastering tools and techniques, but by showing up every day with a mindset focused on
              progress. That experience shaped how I approach challenges, manage teams, and deliver results, no matter
              the industry. It built my confidence and my leadership style—practical, honest, and grounded—and became a
              springboard for everything I've pursued since.

            <h3>Personal Interests</h3>
            <p>
              When I'm not on the job site or behind a screen, I'm all about spending time outdoors and making memories
              with the people I care about. I’ve got a passion for hunting small game, usually in marshland swamps or
              wide open country—quiet places that demand patience, sharp instincts, and a good set of boots. Fishing is
              another favorite, especially when I’m out there with my buddies or sharing the experience with my son;
              there’s something special about a calm morning on the water and the stories that come with it. I’m also
              big on family road trips, whether it’s chasing scenic views or tracking down the best roadside diner.
              Attending rodeos is a tradition I keep close—it’s got that raw energy, community spirit, and just enough
              dust to feel like home. Bonfire nights with the guys and family are a staple—sharing food, laughs, and
              stories under a starry sky. And when the mood strikes, I enjoy shooting skeet, keeping my aim sharp and
              soaking up that rush of competition and focus. When it’s time to wind down, I’m all in for movie nights
              and the occasional shopping trip with my wife—which, let’s be honest, ends up being more fun than I
              expected every time.

          <h3>Beyond the Office</h3>
          <p>
            Family is at the heart of everything I do. As a father, I take pride in guiding my son—sharing experiences
            like fishing trips, teaching him the value of hard work, and showing up as someone he can always count on.
            Being a husband means showing up with love and loyalty, whether that’s in the everyday moments or the big
            milestones, and even on those spontaneous shopping trips that turn into unexpected adventures. I’m also a
            son, shaped by the lessons passed down and the values I carry forward, and a brother to one sister and one
            brother, always having each other's backs through thick and thin. Family isn’t just something I’m part
            of—it’s who I am, woven into my decisions, my grit, and the memories I’m proud to build.
